# Six_Nations_database
Players' data of Six Nations teams from 2010 to 2022

Is it possible to perform sabermetrics on rugby? Or even create a predictive model of rugby tries?
Try to find out using this set of data, which contains players' metrics of the Six Nations' teams from 2010 to 2022. One table for each team organized with name, position, date of birth, age, caps and year of the competition. 

The probability to win the competition can increase with a younger team or a higher number of caps? This and many other questions can have an answer analyzing the composition of every team of the European continent.

Here are stored the teams from 2010 to 2022. Each csv contains player's name, position, date of birth, age and team represented. 
It is possible to read and analyze each year separately, looking one file per time. Otherwise SQL database is already prepared. Running the code will form 12 tables, one per year, where it is possible to store every csv with the import wizard method.
Remember to modify date of birth in every csv in yyyymmdd format before uploading it in SQL.
